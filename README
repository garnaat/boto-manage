This code is focused on building a git-style command line tool that
leverages the boto.manage package for registering and managing EC2
resources.  The boto.manage package predates the EC2 tagging features
and stores metadata about instances and volumes in SimpleDB.

This project is not complete.  The existing "bmg" command works but
only provides a handful of commands.  Still, it might be useful to
someone.
